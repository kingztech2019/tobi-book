    <p><i><b>“Babylon in its might awakens sweet deceits in men, leaving them empty when they feel liberated, false hopes from false gods”
      Peace et
      
      </b></i></p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">The peace advocated in the world by the devil, your flesh causing you to be enslaved by sin, sings a melodious song to your hearing, the goose bumps swells and you are left shattered in her false hopes. This is her language, one too many but under one god, Satan.</p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>Language of pride
</b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    Babylon takes her place in the hearts of men, a very popular and striking influence, manipulating all flesh as ruled by her. Her delicacies are ever pleasant to the lustful tendencies of mankind. Babylon is ruled by the prince of the power of air in the person of Satan, the master enslaved in darkness. She is more real than what you have heard about her, its more than a name but a liaison of the quadripartite, channeling their energy in enslaving souls, captive. Babylon received her conception from Satan, a very talented angel full of knowledge. Satan was formerly a morning star made to shine in the highest heaven, giving glory to the most high and recounting orders from Him to the other angels in the heavenlies. There were categories for all the dwellers of heaven just as we have here on earth but the peace of God reigned over all their affairs until darkness started to incite division. God had been, even before the heavens but Satan didn’t fully realize His limits as explained in the previous chapter. After his fall, he devised means with his skills to get his desired goal against divinity. He enticed man with knowledge, deceiving him that it is all he requires to attain a higher level than God and proves to be the source to his worshippers, mostly unknown to them. Knowledge is good but it has to be within the boundaries of God.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">The form of this knowledge comes in the academics of this world you live in, where man ascends in knowledge and sees himself as the maker of himself without giving honour to whom its due. This is the faulty notion of the conceiver, Satan, who in his arrogance, exalts himself with his gifts and drags others with such self-deception. Nobility ends in a man that refuses to give credence to a higher one. Like the bible says, much of knowledge puffs up a man’s soul, making him see himself as indispensable, a falsehood of all times. Here comes the quadripartite order of the Babylonian appearance of your enemy in their peaceful ventures.</p>

<p style="padding: 10px;"><b>Satan</b></p>
<p style="padding: 10px;"> Satan, the principal enemy of man was created perfect but allowed pride to enslave him to a spiritual wreck. God created both light and darkness, and when He commanded light to emerge from the darkness upon the earth, He didn’t totally eliminate darkness, He let darkness rule at night. Satan was never to be destroyed but made to serve God’s purpose even with his rebellion. He rules the hearts of every one who worships their lustful appetites. Once he knows your desires, he garnishes and advocates them to your undoing. He is the author of sin. Man becomes his subject when he follows in his footsteps. Satan sealed his fate for a second death and hopes to take as many with him. He never forces you to sin but suggests logics to break your wall of truth.
</p>
<p><b>The World</b></p>

<p style="padding: 10px;">The world is the seat of Satan’s territory fashioned to steer man’s way against his creator, she hopes to gather as many armies of men to wage war against everything that stands for light. She is drunk and won’t stop until she sees men follow her in stupor, loving darkness more than the light. She entices you with her flashy adornments like education, cars, money, houses, high- end jobs. She is the mother of the pride of life. The world stands against the truth, the truth of the gospel, the world promises peace which she can never give with her deceits waging conflicts in men’s heart. The world says it’s natural to hate, to lie, to lust for things that are not beneficial to your soul, to accept humanism and religious sect that are brutal to the sanctification of man’s spirit, to refuse helping someone from whom you cannot gain anything in return, to make jest of that poor girl who denies herself to help her blind father who is a widower, wherever she turns to, the world demands that she plays the harlotry to get her favours. The world my friend is evil because it has been placed under the god of sin and pride who tickles fleshly lusts, just as it had been from the garden of Eden, in the time of Adam and Eve. God wants us to be enemy of the world’s standards and system which is far from liberating the soul of man. The existence of this standard is to prove the way of peace that cannot be duplicated because its only one. The way of the world is empty and suicidal, souls languish under her reins, Satan entrenches the system and use it to enslave mortal men lost in the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. We must be an enemy of this heinous system and raise the banner of the truth always. Darkness looms over the world, gross darkness but with the truth comes the light that renders the light bearer the head of all captors, releasing all the captives in darkness into a marvelous light of redemption, a price paid by the truth and light himself, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">The world in its darkness knows the authority of the light and thus, fears its emergence. The world will hate you for your difference but will be attracted to your light which it cannot understand. When you have received the light that lights all men in a dark world, you become the light of the world whereby others can experience enlightenment from their shackles. The world is in dire need of the light which it hates because it cannot give what it doesn’t have, so this causes envy, making every of its tactics devised to upturn the beauty of light within it. The darkness of this world shrouds the flicker of light in you with its distractions, this is what douses the intensity of your light. When you bow to its suggestions, you become doused in the gloom it brews, it takes the truth of God’s word to release you from such obscurity engendered by darkness. The world’s end is ticking as time bomb and in no time will explode. Seek the truth and be freed from the attractions of this world. The world you live in is transient.</p>
   
<p style="padding: 10px;">Satan expanded his malice and directed it toward God’s treasured possession on earth, man. He came as a friend and suggested in his gossip chatter with the first woman, that when she eats the fruit of the knowledge of evil and good, she shall be like God, a similar malice he felt for God, now perpetrating it through another creation like him. And just as he was given the freedom to choose his master, God gave Adam and Eve without restraining them because just like you and me, He gave us a mind of our own to choose whom we believe and follow. It takes a highly secure being to pull this off, no one else can, if you think of any, please send me a message. I know of a King Edward who had the choice of either banishing his friend who planned a coup d’état against him or hanging him to deter his other enemies. Guess what? He chose hanging him to save his leadership and life. I also know of a man who had the choice of banishing his nephew who was the rightful heir to the throne but because he wanted the throne, he put him in the dungeon to rot without mercy. God showed Satan mercy and extended grace by giving him the first heavens to dwell, God could have ended him and who could have dared to question him? God knows that his security is not tied to any of his creations, it didn’t stop him a minute to end it in Noah’s time and it sure won’t change his sovereignty when the heavens and the earth passes away. He is God, all by himself. All other gods have security issues and their ego is tied to their subjects, their act of goodness to their votaries is selfish, this is why God prides in himself, proclaiming- ‘The lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and rebellion and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation-Exodus 34:6-7. Hallelujah!
  Malice isn’t a silent projection towards someone as you believe it to be. When you don’t like someone’s attitude or you discover something ill about that person, you disconnect from him/her and show it by either ignoring, or confronting the person openly, tagging him/ her as your enemy, this is a common and relatable experience felt by all mankind because we have been seduced into eating this evil seed by virtue of our ancestors. After Satan succeeded in sowing the seed of malice in Eve and Adam in the order of his influence, it further brought his total doom. With this realization after the curse, he furthered his antics to set the mind of men against God so he could repent God of all his works, after all, when God destroys everything he created, then there will be no one to worship him and if that happens, as far as he is concerned, he had achieved his goal. What is the honour of God without His creations? Satan was very wrong, GOD ISN'T INSECURE that he should repent or change his mind out of fear. People change their mind so desperately because of fear, fear of what might be. In God’s vision, there is no case of probability, it is always certain, He is ever faithful and ever sure, so nothing can rouse fear in him because he has a perfect love God is love (1 John 4:16b). It is a mental torment, a bodily pain, not to have this perfect love perfected in us. Nothing that the devil attempts takes God unawares, He is the all- knowing- Omniscient God. He is always mighty steps ahead of Satan’s ploy from ancient past till now, the reins of his creations are still very much controlled by him. He never sleeps or slumbers! He is able to make you stand and will not cast you away (Hebrew 9), if only you come to him in your helplessness.
  Silence the sweet melody of malice and let the presence of God drown its hold on you, the acceptance of this seed is an enemy to your soul. Satan didn’t stop worshipping God with praises in His court yard, he was still leading the choral parade in the heavens but his spirit was already descending and decaying and God saw it before he marshalled other angels into joining in his rebellion, promising them a false kingdom. It was only a matter of time for such rebellion to be attended to and an eternity to be judged. God indeed is a God of perfection in time and eternity. His patience awes me much more than his wonders, I can say for a fact that His perfect endurance is a wonder of its own. With perfect endurance brandished by love, He rules over His creation without tyrannical governance. In this world where things have gone hay wire, it is only necessary he judges the earth swiftly but His patient strides wouldn’t let him choose Judgement but mercy and race to give his creation another chance to know Him for who He really is, he does not take so much pleasure in punishing but by His nature, he must visit the iniquity of every man for he is a God that loves Justice (judgement- Jeremiah 9:24- Thus say the Lord, I am the LORD who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness). It is by his first nature of kindness, also mercy, that we are not consumed and in this, He so delights.
  Do you show mercy than condemning those that you feel you are better than? Do you love the soft grip of malice wound around your poor little heart? Do you listen to the peace it promises and continually follow her to the grave of total darkness and lifelessness? Such peace is your enemy! It’s not a place to be. <b>Man, choose wisdom, for therein lies your freedom. Malice is a friendly foe of your very soul.</b>
  </p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>The language of Jealousy
  </b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">Pride and jealousy are best of friends, so passionate about their friendship, sending a pungent odour to their host, the enemy uses these duos to pin you down, when you detach from their association, it’s only natural for you to stand tall and straight. These two languages dominate the evil realm of darkness which is why people that frequently become enslaved by these two, consent to witchcraft without their knowledge and when they go deeper in the ocean of the two lovers, they become lost, always on their knees, sinking to perdition. Jealousy when directed towards darkness diminishes you from your high horse but when directed towards pure light, it exalts your whole being to its destiny. We should only direct our jealousy to the creator of the heavens and the earth, not to any creation. This is an insult to the Father of all spirits and flesh, if you remain in the gathering of impure jealousy, you must decline. Stop worshipping it but worship God, God showed that jealousy can be good, after all, He created light in darkness, so He can create good in every evil, what a marvelous God! He showed jealousy for his creation and rose to come down to save all (john 3:16- for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, passionately(jealously), that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life). A jealously passionate God came to the rescue of his precious creatures in a bid to help them regain their pristine destiny lost to their enemy, Satan from the fall. 
    <br>What have you been jealous of lately? Is it towards your fellow men? Honestly, it’s not worth your energy at all, instead just direct that jealousy and focus on God. Delight passionately in his pleasures and he will grant you the desires of your heart (psalm 82). Jealousy gives you that sense of peace that you are doing the right thing, that you deserve it more than the other person but deep down, you know the bitterness it fuels within you bites. Oh, what a sweet foretaste but bitter sediments in your belly, how gruesome! I have been there and I know truly that its peace is truly deceptive, it comes as a pleasantly sweet medicine but when you swallow it, true revelation begins its torment in your belly. Jealousy is as strong as the grave. It lives within the dark gates of the grave. When it catches up with you, it clamps you down to her residence. You can be released from its shackles when you receive the head of all captives as your Lord, his name is Jesus Christ, a name dreaded in the dark world. say this words: I know that I have been jealous and proud and done terrible things but I choose not to hold my peace which is my enemy but confess my sins and I believe that for this reason, Jesus died for my sins that I may be set free to eternal life of abundance and his glory, Amen! Thank God, you are freed by these confessions, welcome to the kingdom of light where Jesus Christ reigns supreme. You are reborn and now see the kingdom (John 3:6) where more tactics of your enemy is exposed. In this kingdom, just as our forerunner in the race of absolute victory, our God in the flesh in the person of Jesus Christ, we must make a show of the pride and lies of the enemy and shame him publicly by the victory on the cross of Christ (Col 2:15b) Friend, if you do not come to this cross and take your kingdom share of this victory, what do you live for? Accept the man on the cross as your God and share in his victory as your lot, the Father has so graciously given you. This is the place to be, a place of ease. 
    </p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>The language of lies</b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>Lies are many but the truth is one!</b>The beauty of lies is deceptive just as its name. There, is a conglomeration of spirits that multiplies from its possession. Lies have broadened its reach and hold over men from the father of lies himself, the devil. He forged it in the heavens at the royal courts of God, when he deceived himself in pride of what he could become, he refused to accept his limits and worshipped the lies of being the only supreme. How does he think God can create something more powerful or wiser than himself? Satan, lied to himself and passed it to his admirers in God’s courtyard. The only intelligence of a creature lies in the awareness of his limits. No one can challenge God or take away from him, His supremacy; that is the greatest deception ever, this, the devil is aware of because times have taught him this lesson. Are you caught in self-deception? There is a fearful fall awaiting such man that knows not his limits. Jesus Christ knew his limits as a man and he humbly respected that understanding, nothing else in this world can be more noble. A God made flesh respected these limits even He created in mankind, God couldn’t break the limits he already imposed on man from creation, even if he had to come to their realm and identify with humanity, this principle couldn’t be downplayed. He knew the boundaries, what a noble God I have come to know and understand! Happier are those whom is given a deeper understanding. 
    <br>When you lie, you get this feeling of self- exaltation because you only lie to magnify your image beyond your true vintage. You feel a reassuring peace encouraging you to believe more and before you know it, you act according to its dictates and you better get ready for the full feast of the lies convoy in your heart. They found that place and they must be worshipped. Tell me, what lies have you been worshipping all your life? Or maybe if I may ask: what lies have you worshipped and what has time taught you about them? I am very sure you must have gotten your answers with a sweet gift of time and if you haven’t realized this lies, only time again will tell. Darkness hover around in lies but with the mind of God on His clock, is light revealed. No matter how deep the lies you passionately attach to, God’s vision of light can filter light out of your darkness, this He did in the creation of this world you live in. God is the father of lights (John 1:) piercing through the dead darkness, bringing light out of its captivity. Yes, he created darkness, after all, all things that are (seen and unseen) were created by him, this is why he can call out light out of the unlikely, He delights in all His works. Let me remind you of how He made the red sea part into two, making them stand upright as a wall, by which the Israelites moved (exodus 2:) God indeed is a miracle worker in the most unbelievable ways in finite eyes and minds. Or is it the sweetest wine ever, made from a neutral solution as water? Even science cannot fathom the explanation of this statement, much less, reproduce such work with all their wisdom put together, God has confounded the wisdom of this world time and again and as it is with its master, it will keep on deceiving itself till the time factor catches up with eternity’s reactor. Praise be to God. As it was in the beginning, now is and shall be forevermore, no radical of this world can end or disrupt it.
    The devil further possessed the other angels- now demons- with the lies he so worshipped and all their praises to God became a blasphemy in disguise. God wasn’t about to have such evil in his presence, so he graciously gave him the freedom to the path he chose for himself, the descending path. This is what happens when you choose the ways of lies, you put your very soul in the descending motion, it’s a principle older than the mountains. The place of all liars is in the descending lake of fire, you wallow up and down in this lake of torment (Revelation 21:8). The angels he fooled must have thought God weak but just like their master, the devil, they couldn’t comprehend God’s diversity and supremacy. It’s always like that for darkness, it never can comprehend the light. Time reveals this unto eternity. Right after God saw the darkness before his presence, a war erupted that brought a division commanded by God. There must be a war because light cannot stand darkness for too long, this is the mystery of light and darkness from the ancient world. so the devil and his cohorts got their disgruntled self, banished from the heaven of the most high God to the lower heavens because heavens were made for spirits alone contrary to earth being created for all flesh. This is why we have them ruling the space of the sky, preventing man’s total access to God with the sin it dispersed throughout humanity. He came down in the flesh of a serpent and deceived an unsuspecting woman in the garden. She was made to believe the lies of becoming as God, when God said this about you and me in the book of psalms: ye are gods. He meant we are to reproduce his nature within the boundaries of the earth He has put us in. Tell me a man who has been to heaven and refused to be humble. That is what the privilege of being in God’s presence does to you when a mortal enters the immortal. What a great privilege only few have been graced to enjoy! They enjoyed the honor because they desired it and pleased God. Jesus Christ pleased the father who sent him and he brought heaven to earth, understanding his limits in an earthly body. God laid this foundation and marked out principles governing every radical of the world, a principle that can never be bypassed, He is the only integrity I know. 
    <br>As it is with the devil, he still wanders around the earth in any form he so chooses, appearing in the friendliest, peaceful and logical body to get man become his accomplice in repenting God of all his creations. I am glad, God knows better and has the final authority on every matter, he already decided that those that come to him, believing his son, Jesus Christ, will not perish but enjoy everlasting life (john 3:16). It doesn’t matter the antics of the devil; God is wiser than all his creations. Wiser than science and technology, wiser than philosophers of all time in all their generations, He is the only wise God, He is not like humans who can build a super intelligent computer, more intelligent than them. God knows better than that. He is the only intelligence there is, He has a limit levelled on the dominion given man, this is why when men in their unity attempted building a tower that touched the heavens, their plans were foiled because no creation could overrule such byelaws that governed the world, time again has taught the devil, only he confuses himself the more because God had released to him- a reprobate mind, an illogical mind as pharaoh in the bible who didn’t want to accept a higher authority and of course by the gift of time, he wallowed in the sea of realization and total doom. This is what awaits Satan and those that follow him arrogantly. Their final end is the depths of their full darkness. Let the light of God open your eyes to His true vision for you. He placed this boundary to protect you, not because he feels threatened at all. You can see the damages incurred from science and technology, its danger to our very lives, a threat to our existence. These things as good as they have helped, do more harm than good. You are very much aware of this fact, talk about weapons, means of transportation, etc. we can’t even control them anymore. This is what makes a boundary very paramount to put things in their right course. The seas know their limits, the birds do, the animals do, the clouds do, the planetary bodies do, even the heavens interact according to the set boundaries. What then is wrong with humans? Lies perpetrated by the instigator of all lies, the devil, is the cause of the woes that had befallen mankind. Lies decay your soul and leave you miserable, it takes the grace of God with His truth and your willingness to break free from its shackles. This invention was instituted by Satan and he aims to drag as many as he can to the dead pool of doom, where he is to end with his disgruntled agents. 
    <br>Enter into the kingdom of light and start getting your mind renewed by the truth where your true image is revealed. You are worth more and cherished more because of your limitations, don’t feel ashamed of them, man. All things are possible? No! All things are possible with God? A loud yes! It is only with God allowing it, is anything possible and visible too. No God, no possibility because he determines what’s possible and you can determine it when you are on His side like Joshua, who commanded the sun to remain static because He was fighting the enemies with God on His side. When you are with God, you can command him of his works because He says to, in the book of Isaiah (). This is how much he loves man, if only you know the depth of his love for mankind, you will indeed respond in tears of how a great God can humbly regard mere dusts like you and me. The reason is because he sees himself when he looks at us and our weakness draws him to us which is why he promises never to strive with us because He knows and understands our weakness and will help us become more. We are fearfully and wonderfully made(psalm). Our weakness endears him to help us. God has not given up on man, He personally hasn’t given up on you and he won’t start now. Satan had gone beyond redemption because he refuses to open up his state of confusion, pride did it all. You can come with your weakness and God will help you stand in His strength because His strength is made perfect in your weakness (2cor 17:28). Don’t believe the lies of the enemy and the peace it promises you, you can never be set free with those lies. Lies are the guards at the gate of captivity. And because the mercy of God has looked on the earth, His truth has hit the world, righteousness and peace must prevail. This is the joy of every believer of the truth, righteousness, and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God who always gives us victory through Jesus Christ.
    <br>Darkness looms around in the web of lies, you must escape from the web with the infusion of the light that smolders the web, melting its hold on you. Lies is but for a moment, but the truth must endure throughout all generations because the truth is one, has always been and will always be. The truth is the Christ, who is the same: yesterday, today, and forever (Heb 13:8)
    <br>What lies have you told and believed about yourself? Is it about your past? They don’t define you, Christ has defined them, you must accept and embrace the new image he has created in you. It is the truth that is in Jesus Christ that shall make you free. The devil has laid an allegation but the intercessor is ever zealous to win your case
