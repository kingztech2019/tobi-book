    <p><i><b>“I speak for you to hear me; this is my language for you to be enslaved”
      Your enemy
      </b></i></p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">The peace advocated in the world by the devil, your flesh causing you to be enslaved by sin, sings a melodious song to your hearing, the goose bumps swells and you are left shattered in her false hopes. This is her language, one too many but under one god, Satan.</p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>Language of pride
</b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    “By my appearance, I am feared, who can outshine me or
     who compares to my royalty? I am the majesty, bringing
      mankind to travesty. I am the only gifted, excellence 
      lifted and singer respected.” I can relate the speaker
       of this words to be the devil himself, the father of 
       all pride. I have been there before and I can tell 
       you the attention is magnificent like an edifice with
        your throne carved in its glory, you just feel 
        outright peace knowing you are incomparably 
        significant. God must have been irritated because 
        when I sense such arrogance in someone, 
        I get so sick in the stomach that I want to just 
        vomit. This is why when God senses pride in you, 
        it unnerves Him to cause you to fall like Satan and 
        his angels were fallen from the place of promotion 
        to their place of demotion. This is what you get for
         harboring and exalting pride.</p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">On a cold Tuesday, ninety-year-old Mrs. Johnson got a call from her grandson about his plan to visit her by the weekend but she had another plan to receive members of her assembly for a house fellowship at her house. Wondering how she could kill two birds with a stone, she suggested he come later in the evening after the fellowship to which he agreed. Fast forward to the weekend, she arranged for refreshments to be served her guests before their arrival on the Saturday morning. Mrs. Johnson was very happy as she was ready to refresh them beyond their expectation since they would be gathering at her house for the first time, she had been soliciting for this for months until they decided to change their base for fellowship, this was like winning a trophy to her and she reminded herself that nothing was going to ruin this day; until just before she assimilated the reminder, one of her maid, robin, took her by surprise, asking, “Ma, I can’t seem to find the particular muffin sets you sent for, should I buy the ones I found here and start coming home?” Mrs. Johnson couldn’t have the disappointment, she wanted that particular muffin sets and nothing more, she had her assembly’s member to show off to and a grandson to receive in a grand style. Before she could welcome any unwanted suggestion, she flared and shouted over the phone, “Robin, don’t come home until you find what I requested.” Pooong!! She hung the phone and slammed it across her table. That was all that was needed to make Mrs. Johnson feel terrible- a day with failing plans. Like that was not enough for the morning, Mercy, her other maid broke her inheritance- a glass jar from the forties which she claimed was passed on from the 12th generations down to her- a precious gift from the great ones. With all these, she couldn’t contain herself as she simmered all over in her room. Much to her chagrin, she heard a voice and then voices, calling her name down the stairs, after few seconds of cerebral calm, Mrs. Johnson recognized that it was her pastor and the other members in her house already, she quickly brushed her hair to look the part and called mercy to get her bag downstairs and tell them she was on her way to join them. With the thought of everything going topsy –turvy, she murmured and cursed under her breath, forgetting to carry her stick for support. As she took the third step downward, she slipped and rolled to the end of the stairs and screamed with fear. Hearing the noise, they all rushed to her rescue, only to find her dazed and crying in pains, cursing and fuming. Then they heard the bell rang, it was robin and the driver looking all disappointed because of the unsuccessful shopping. Forgetting her pains, Mrs. Johnson jolted, facing robin, “where are the muffins set?”, Mmmaaa, we didn’t find it, we have scouted everywhere but no success, even Mr. Josiah is very tired, he had driven to all the malls we can find, I am very sorry ma but those sets are out of stocks for now.” Oh will you shut that trap, and stop telling me crap! she interrupted robin, “just look at the way you are dressed, I always tell you to dress decently, all my children are well behaved and decent and they passed these values to their children, why are you adamant? Oh, for God’s sake!” Before the whole message could be received, the bell rang and this time it was her grandson and granddaughter at the door, when she saw them after being helped up, she motioned to them to come her way and give her a hug. The whole drama didn’t permit her to check their appearance as she always does but after she caught the warm embrace of her granddaughter, she was ashamed with the realization of her gross indecency which she noticed the appalling look on her pastor’s face and the others. The pastor couldn’t hide his feeling, so he requested, “Mrs. Johnson, please find something for your granddaughter to cover her nakedness, we just cannot gather with this sight, “Unknown to Tasha that it was grandma’s pastor, she retorted with disdain, “what is wrong with my dressing old fool? you are feeling uneasy because this is exactly what you wish for from your old wife at home or maybe here with you but you cannot have it, so it hits you so hard that you cannot stand this seductress before you” Deaconess Mrs. Johnson, I can’t believe I am seeing and hearing this, well we have to leave, thank you for having us but we can’t but want to gather at our former base, we thought you were worthy by your position to have us here as you inquired.” Well you don’t need to be told the following events other than the loss of Mrs. Johnson title in her assembly and for all the refreshments awaiting her guests, they never served their purposes. Pride is terrible and after it, comes a shameful fall, and after that fall are more falls! BEWARE! 
</p>
<p style="padding: 10px;"><b>The language of Malice</b></p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">Malice is a heinous monster nursed in the secret place of hatred, you show malice when you are jealous of someone and portray pride in the position of your heart. These are the demons you love even when they leave you tormented and stab you leaving shrills in your heart, you still follow them because they make their attachment soothing and peaceful. They drag you to their nets and enslave you to your unrest, they appeal to your flesh and control you till you thresh. The genesis of malice started in the heavens at the court yard of God, malice was cultivated against him by his own creature who wanted to usurp him from his throne due to outright pride and jealousy. The creature, Lucipher, now Satan, swallowed this darkness and became its servants as purposed by God, who is the unchangeable changer (Malachi 2). God saw the darkness welling up in him and ordained that he must stay in the realm he chose for himself, God gave freedom to his creatures, even the angels, his vulnerability makes him the only true God who isn’t afraid of the presence of his enemy in his space, same thing modelled by Jesus Christ who loved Judas Iscariot, knowing he was going to be betrayed by him for his love for money. God still converses with Satan and Jesus followed the devil to the places he was tempted but still overcame, we can when we wrestle him from the point of love, something no one can ever attempt out of fear of losing his ego. No wonder, it says in 1john4:18 that perfect love casts out fear, with such perfect love he could conquer his enemy. If you are still afraid of your enemy, God’s love has yet to be perfected in you. God’s love doesn’t enslave but frees us.
</p>
<p style="padding: 10px;">Satan expanded his malice and directed it toward God’s treasured possession on earth, man. He came as a friend and suggested in his gossip chatter with the first woman, that when she eats the fruit of the knowledge of evil and good, she shall be like God, a similar malice he felt for God, now perpetrating it through another creation like him. And just as he was given the freedom to choose his master, God gave Adam and Eve without restraining them because just like you and me, He gave us a mind of our own to choose whom we believe and follow. It takes a highly secure being to pull this off, no one else can, if you think of any, please send me a message. I know of a King Edward who had the choice of either banishing his friend who planned a coup d’état against him or hanging him to deter his other enemies. Guess what? He chose hanging him to save his leadership and life. I also know of a man who had the choice of banishing his nephew who was the rightful heir to the throne but because he wanted the throne, he put him in the dungeon to rot without mercy. God showed Satan mercy and extended grace by giving him the first heavens to dwell, God could have ended him and who could have dared to question him? God knows that his security is not tied to any of his creations, it didn’t stop him a minute to end it in Noah’s time and it sure won’t change his sovereignty when the heavens and the earth passes away. He is God, all by himself. All other gods have security issues and their ego is tied to their subjects, their act of goodness to their votaries is selfish, this is why God prides in himself, proclaiming- ‘The lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and rebellion and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation-Exodus 34:6-7. Hallelujah!
  Malice isn’t a silent projection towards someone as you believe it to be. When you don’t like someone’s attitude or you discover something ill about that person, you disconnect from him/her and show it by either ignoring, or confronting the person openly, tagging him/ her as your enemy, this is a common and relatable experience felt by all mankind because we have been seduced into eating this evil seed by virtue of our ancestors. After Satan succeeded in sowing the seed of malice in Eve and Adam in the order of his influence, it further brought his total doom. With this realization after the curse, he furthered his antics to set the mind of men against God so he could repent God of all his works, after all, when God destroys everything he created, then there will be no one to worship him and if that happens, as far as he is concerned, he had achieved his goal. What is the honour of God without His creations? Satan was very wrong, GOD ISN'T INSECURE that he should repent or change his mind out of fear. People change their mind so desperately because of fear, fear of what might be. In God’s vision, there is no case of probability, it is always certain, He is ever faithful and ever sure, so nothing can rouse fear in him because he has a perfect love God is love (1 John 4:16b). It is a mental torment, a bodily pain, not to have this perfect love perfected in us. Nothing that the devil attempts takes God unawares, He is the all- knowing- Omniscient God. He is always mighty steps ahead of Satan’s ploy from ancient past till now, the reins of his creations are still very much controlled by him. He never sleeps or slumbers! He is able to make you stand and will not cast you away (Hebrew 9), if only you come to him in your helplessness.
  Silence the sweet melody of malice and let the presence of God drown its hold on you, the acceptance of this seed is an enemy to your soul. Satan didn’t stop worshipping God with praises in His court yard, he was still leading the choral parade in the heavens but his spirit was already descending and decaying and God saw it before he marshalled other angels into joining in his rebellion, promising them a false kingdom. It was only a matter of time for such rebellion to be attended to and an eternity to be judged. God indeed is a God of perfection in time and eternity. His patience awes me much more than his wonders, I can say for a fact that His perfect endurance is a wonder of its own. With perfect endurance brandished by love, He rules over His creation without tyrannical governance. In this world where things have gone hay wire, it is only necessary he judges the earth swiftly but His patient strides wouldn’t let him choose Judgement but mercy and race to give his creation another chance to know Him for who He really is, he does not take so much pleasure in punishing but by His nature, he must visit the iniquity of every man for he is a God that loves Justice (judgement- Jeremiah 9:24- Thus say the Lord, I am the LORD who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness). It is by his first nature of kindness, also mercy, that we are not consumed and in this, He so delights.
  Do you show mercy than condemning those that you feel you are better than? Do you love the soft grip of malice wound around your poor little heart? Do you listen to the peace it promises and continually follow her to the grave of total darkness and lifelessness? Such peace is your enemy! It’s not a place to be. <b>Man, choose wisdom, for therein lies your freedom. Malice is a friendly foe of your very soul.</b>
  </p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>The language of Jealousy
  </b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">Pride and jealousy are best of friends, so passionate about their friendship, sending a pungent odour to their host, the enemy uses these duos to pin you down, when you detach from their association, it’s only natural for you to stand tall and straight. These two languages dominate the evil realm of darkness which is why people that frequently become enslaved by these two, consent to witchcraft without their knowledge and when they go deeper in the ocean of the two lovers, they become lost, always on their knees, sinking to perdition. Jealousy when directed towards darkness diminishes you from your high horse but when directed towards pure light, it exalts your whole being to its destiny. We should only direct our jealousy to the creator of the heavens and the earth, not to any creation. This is an insult to the Father of all spirits and flesh, if you remain in the gathering of impure jealousy, you must decline. Stop worshipping it but worship God, God showed that jealousy can be good, after all, He created light in darkness, so He can create good in every evil, what a marvelous God! He showed jealousy for his creation and rose to come down to save all (john 3:16- for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, passionately(jealously), that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life). A jealously passionate God came to the rescue of his precious creatures in a bid to help them regain their pristine destiny lost to their enemy, Satan from the fall. 
    <br>What have you been jealous of lately? Is it towards your fellow men? Honestly, it’s not worth your energy at all, instead just direct that jealousy and focus on God. Delight passionately in his pleasures and he will grant you the desires of your heart (psalm 82). Jealousy gives you that sense of peace that you are doing the right thing, that you deserve it more than the other person but deep down, you know the bitterness it fuels within you bites. Oh, what a sweet foretaste but bitter sediments in your belly, how gruesome! I have been there and I know truly that its peace is truly deceptive, it comes as a pleasantly sweet medicine but when you swallow it, true revelation begins its torment in your belly. Jealousy is as strong as the grave. It lives within the dark gates of the grave. When it catches up with you, it clamps you down to her residence. You can be released from its shackles when you receive the head of all captives as your Lord, his name is Jesus Christ, a name dreaded in the dark world. say this words: I know that I have been jealous and proud and done terrible things but I choose not to hold my peace which is my enemy but confess my sins and I believe that for this reason, Jesus died for my sins that I may be set free to eternal life of abundance and his glory, Amen! Thank God, you are freed by these confessions, welcome to the kingdom of light where Jesus Christ reigns supreme. You are reborn and now see the kingdom (John 3:6) where more tactics of your enemy is exposed. In this kingdom, just as our forerunner in the race of absolute victory, our God in the flesh in the person of Jesus Christ, we must make a show of the pride and lies of the enemy and shame him publicly by the victory on the cross of Christ (Col 2:15b) Friend, if you do not come to this cross and take your kingdom share of this victory, what do you live for? Accept the man on the cross as your God and share in his victory as your lot, the Father has so graciously given you. This is the place to be, a place of ease. 
    </p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>The language of lies</b></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px;"><b>Lies are many but the truth is one!</b>The beauty of lies is deceptive just as its name. There, is a conglomeration of spirits that multiplies from its possession. Lies have broadened its reach and hold over men from the father of lies himself, the devil. He forged it in the heavens at the royal courts of God, when he deceived himself in pride of what he could become, he refused to accept his limits and worshipped the lies of being the only supreme. How does he think God can create something more powerful or wiser than himself? Satan, lied to himself and passed it to his admirers in God’s courtyard. The only intelligence of a creature lies in the awareness of his limits. No one can challenge God or take away from him, His supremacy; that is the greatest deception ever, this, the devil is aware of because times have taught him this lesson. Are you caught in self-deception? There is a fearful fall awaiting such man that knows not his limits. Jesus Christ knew his limits as a man and he humbly respected that understanding, nothing else in this world can be more noble. A God made flesh respected these limits even He created in mankind, God couldn’t break the limits he already imposed on man from creation, even if he had to come to their realm and identify with humanity, this principle couldn’t be downplayed. He knew the boundaries, what a noble God I have come to know and understand! Happier are those whom is given a deeper understanding. 
    <br>When you lie, you get this feeling of self- exaltation because you only lie to magnify your image beyond your true vintage. You feel a reassuring peace encouraging you to believe more and before you know it, you act according to its dictates and you better get ready for the full feast of the lies convoy in your heart. They found that place and they must be worshipped. Tell me, what lies have you been worshipping all your life? Or maybe if I may ask: what lies have you worshipped and what has time taught you about them? I am very sure you must have gotten your answers with a sweet gift of time and if you haven’t realized this lies, only time again will tell. Darkness hover around in lies but with the mind of God on His clock, is light revealed. No matter how deep the lies you passionately attach to, God’s vision of light can filter light out of your darkness, this He did in the creation of this world you live in. God is the father of lights (John 1:) piercing through the dead darkness, bringing light out of its captivity. Yes, he created darkness, after all, all things that are (seen and unseen) were created by him, this is why he can call out light out of the unlikely, He delights in all His works. Let me remind you of how He made the red sea part into two, making them stand upright as a wall, by which the Israelites moved (exodus 2:) God indeed is a miracle worker in the most unbelievable ways in finite eyes and minds. Or is it the sweetest wine ever, made from a neutral solution as water? Even science cannot fathom the explanation of this statement, much less, reproduce such work with all their wisdom put together, God has confounded the wisdom of this world time and again and as it is with its master, it will keep on deceiving itself till the time factor catches up with eternity’s reactor. Praise be to God. As it was in the beginning, now is and shall be forevermore, no radical of this world can end or disrupt it.
    The devil further possessed the other angels- now demons- with the lies he so worshipped and all their praises to God became a blasphemy in disguise. God wasn’t about to have such evil in his presence, so he graciously gave him the freedom to the path he chose for himself, the descending path. This is what happens when you choose the ways of lies, you put your very soul in the descending motion, it’s a principle older than the mountains. The place of all liars is in the descending lake of fire, you wallow up and down in this lake of torment (Revelation 21:8). The angels he fooled must have thought God weak but just like their master, the devil, they couldn’t comprehend God’s diversity and supremacy. It’s always like that for darkness, it never can comprehend the light. Time reveals this unto eternity. Right after God saw the darkness before his presence, a war erupted that brought a division commanded by God. There must be a war because light cannot stand darkness for too long, this is the mystery of light and darkness from the ancient world. so the devil and his cohorts got their disgruntled self, banished from the heaven of the most high God to the lower heavens because heavens were made for spirits alone contrary to earth being created for all flesh. This is why we have them ruling the space of the sky, preventing man’s total access to God with the sin it dispersed throughout humanity. He came down in the flesh of a serpent and deceived an unsuspecting woman in the garden. She was made to believe the lies of becoming as God, when God said this about you and me in the book of psalms: ye are gods. He meant we are to reproduce his nature within the boundaries of the earth He has put us in. Tell me a man who has been to heaven and refused to be humble. That is what the privilege of being in God’s presence does to you when a mortal enters the immortal. What a great privilege only few have been graced to enjoy! They enjoyed the honor because they desired it and pleased God. Jesus Christ pleased the father who sent him and he brought heaven to earth, understanding his limits in an earthly body. God laid this foundation and marked out principles governing every radical of the world, a principle that can never be bypassed, He is the only integrity I know. 
    <br>As it is with the devil, he still wanders around the earth in any form he so chooses, appearing in the friendliest, peaceful and logical body to get man become his accomplice in repenting God of all his creations. I am glad, God knows better and has the final authority on every matter, he already decided that those that come to him, believing his son, Jesus Christ, will not perish but enjoy everlasting life (john 3:16). It doesn’t matter the antics of the devil; God is wiser than all his creations. Wiser than science and technology, wiser than philosophers of all time in all their generations, He is the only wise God, He is not like humans who can build a super intelligent computer, more intelligent than them. God knows better than that. He is the only intelligence there is, He has a limit levelled on the dominion given man, this is why when men in their unity attempted building a tower that touched the heavens, their plans were foiled because no creation could overrule such byelaws that governed the world, time again has taught the devil, only he confuses himself the more because God had released to him- a reprobate mind, an illogical mind as pharaoh in the bible who didn’t want to accept a higher authority and of course by the gift of time, he wallowed in the sea of realization and total doom. This is what awaits Satan and those that follow him arrogantly. Their final end is the depths of their full darkness. Let the light of God open your eyes to His true vision for you. He placed this boundary to protect you, not because he feels threatened at all. You can see the damages incurred from science and technology, its danger to our very lives, a threat to our existence. These things as good as they have helped, do more harm than good. You are very much aware of this fact, talk about weapons, means of transportation, etc. we can’t even control them anymore. This is what makes a boundary very paramount to put things in their right course. The seas know their limits, the birds do, the animals do, the clouds do, the planetary bodies do, even the heavens interact according to the set boundaries. What then is wrong with humans? Lies perpetrated by the instigator of all lies, the devil, is the cause of the woes that had befallen mankind. Lies decay your soul and leave you miserable, it takes the grace of God with His truth and your willingness to break free from its shackles. This invention was instituted by Satan and he aims to drag as many as he can to the dead pool of doom, where he is to end with his disgruntled agents. 
    <br>Enter into the kingdom of light and start getting your mind renewed by the truth where your true image is revealed. You are worth more and cherished more because of your limitations, don’t feel ashamed of them, man. All things are possible? No! All things are possible with God? A loud yes! It is only with God allowing it, is anything possible and visible too. No God, no possibility because he determines what’s possible and you can determine it when you are on His side like Joshua, who commanded the sun to remain static because He was fighting the enemies with God on His side. When you are with God, you can command him of his works because He says to, in the book of Isaiah (). This is how much he loves man, if only you know the depth of his love for mankind, you will indeed respond in tears of how a great God can humbly regard mere dusts like you and me. The reason is because he sees himself when he looks at us and our weakness draws him to us which is why he promises never to strive with us because He knows and understands our weakness and will help us become more. We are fearfully and wonderfully made(psalm). Our weakness endears him to help us. God has not given up on man, He personally hasn’t given up on you and he won’t start now. Satan had gone beyond redemption because he refuses to open up his state of confusion, pride did it all. You can come with your weakness and God will help you stand in His strength because His strength is made perfect in your weakness (2cor 17:28). Don’t believe the lies of the enemy and the peace it promises you, you can never be set free with those lies. Lies are the guards at the gate of captivity. And because the mercy of God has looked on the earth, His truth has hit the world, righteousness and peace must prevail. This is the joy of every believer of the truth, righteousness, and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God who always gives us victory through Jesus Christ.
    <br>Darkness looms around in the web of lies, you must escape from the web with the infusion of the light that smolders the web, melting its hold on you. Lies is but for a moment, but the truth must endure throughout all generations because the truth is one, has always been and will always be. The truth is the Christ, who is the same: yesterday, today, and forever (Heb 13:8)
    <br>What lies have you told and believed about yourself? Is it about your past? They don’t define you, Christ has defined them, you must accept and embrace the new image he has created in you. It is the truth that is in Jesus Christ that shall make you free. The devil has laid an allegation but the intercessor is ever zealous to win your case
