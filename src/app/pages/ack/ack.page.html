  The God of perfect peace who confounds the mighty and wise things of this world through the base and foolish like me, to Him be all the glory. He has revealed Himself to me in several ways and I can tell that I know Him and would do exploits in His name. The highest good and only good in this vain world has flooded my heart with his life-giving light and I must wield that light and spread it to all, without whom it would have been impossible to make this book a reality, His burning light led to its release. Thank you merciful and gracious Father, calling the lowly and wearing them the beautiful shoes of peace to trample on the enemy who will never know peace.
I must honour my earthly father by the name of Brother John Etim, a man dearly loved by my lord, Jesus Christ who is joyfully his as well. Daddy, you will never understand the depth of God’s love for you in this mortal life, He alone can show you the best. We have found the way to go about it, not the way of this world, all honor to the God of the World International Sacred Peace Movement, Okinawa and the Grouped soul all over the world. 
I also acknowledge the one to whom this book was dedicated, “Mama Tobi,” the most industrious and confident woman I have ever known, it’s a blessing to be raised by you with your weakness put together. Your popularity and temerity in the community of Itamaga lives on in me and your wonderful sons- my great brothers. Your values of hard work instilled in me has made me a better person, you are worth more than rubies and gold, and you add up to my heroines of faith. Thank you for the diadem laid gracefully on my little head, Jesus Christ made it fit in. The baton you handed me that day you slept peacefully is heavy but I have learnt to take it to Jesus. Yes, Jesus, the man of galilee whose praise is always on your lips- that I remember! You showed me that a woman needed to be strong, which is why I am strong, thanks to your diligence, I have learnt to appreciate the gift of work which is why I can move a rock with Jesus still.
I must acknowledge the grouped soul in Nigeria, we are one body, one family, Christ’s church. All honor to the God of the World International Sacred Peace Movement, Okinawa and the Grouped soul all over the world. It is the zero tolerance for denomination faction that has brought me closer to Jesus Christ than I ever was. Thank you, our supreme brethren charged to show us the messiah, the highest supreme brother. It is through the teachings of Christ through you that I can call Jesus, my brother. Though I have not found the grace to see you in physical but one thing connects us, the spirit of Christ who is governed by peace, perfect endurance and above all, love. Through the spirit, I know perfect peace is mine and fruitfulness.

I want to acknowledge my three bodyguards, the trio with whom I share same bloodline: Jonathan, Emmanuel and Ndifreke. You guys are awesome; God couldn’t give me the best siblings as you three. I believe in the dreams God showed you, fly with it by all means, you are all made for the skyline, I am hoping for God’s grace multiplied for all your affliction, remember, God is our exceeding reward, it’s been told from the very beginning that we are for Him only, never forget that. Be strong and courageous, and know that your God is good always.

I want to appreciate those that have supported me in all walks of life, to you I say a big thank you. I thank all the authors, writers and philosophers, God’s generals of all time through whom I have come to believe that a renewed mind is the pen’s life, causing great healing and change in every humble soul. Following a true leader arrests every mind battle and brings you to pure clarity in which others must be led. Without this baton I wielded in the realm, I would have maintained a malevolent peace. I am glad we didn’t hold our peace, hide our pen, and clasp our fingers. The baton is well received. Till I see you with my very eyes, I say, Maranatha!
I must also acknowledge you my student reading this book, you are the motivation behind the intimacy I have come to enjoy with God, it is to see you enlightened and freed that I sought to find the only source of light and freedom through whom we have peace. For you to get this book shows you are not afraid of anything and it takes pure humility to glean knowledge from a little me, the difference is the God in me. Thanks for your time investment, this is to give you a better perspective of the earthly kingdom wherein you reside, without this knowledge you may perish for the sons of God perish for lack of knowledge. Right now, rise and build all that is broken and find all that is lost, for in your building and finding is your total freedom and perfect peace in Christ Jesus.
Also, I want to acknowledge a great Manager with the heart of gold and the warmest personality ever, Mr. Victor Ezeibe. Words alone cannot express how proud I am of you, your diligence and humility reminds me of the graciousness of Christ, my Lord and I must prove that, “those who most have been forgiven, have most of love- a powerful excerpt from Sankey Ira’s sacred songs and solos- hymn 467.
Finally, I want to appreciate my gifted and ebullient publishers, editors, marketers and mobile app developer. God will continue to increase your profits. This whole publication was possible with your help, thanks for multiplying the talents God gave you.
